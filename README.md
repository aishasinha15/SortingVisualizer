# SortingVisualizer
[Sorting Visualizer](https://sortingvisualizeraishasinha.netlify.app/)
is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms. The app provides an intuitive, graphical representation of how sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process in real-time.

## Features:

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch the step-by-step sorting process with animated bars representing array elements.
- **Different Sorting Algorithms:**
      - Bubble Sort
      - Insertion Sort
      - Selection Sort
      - Quick Sort
      - Merge Sort
      - Heap Sort
- **Adjustable Array Size:** Change the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform.
- **Array Reset:** Generate new arrays to sort.
- **Responsive UI:** Easily adjust settings and start sorting with the click of a button.

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:** React
- **Styling:** CSS (custom styles for animations)
- [Hosting: Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## How It Works:

- Select a sorting algorithm from the header.
- Set the array size using the slider.
- Click "Sort" to start visualizing the algorithm.
- Reset the array to test the same or different algorithm on new data.

## Algorithms Explained:

- **Bubble Sort:** Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort:** Selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element.
- **Merge Sort:** A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array in half, recursively sorts, and merges the halves.
- **Quick Sort:** Picks a pivot element, partitions the array, and sorts the partitions recursively.
- **Heap Sort:** Builds a heap from the array, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and restores the heap property.

### How to Run the Project Locally:
