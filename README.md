# SortingVisualizer
[Sorting Visualizer](https://sortingvisualizeraishasinha.netlify.app/)
is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms. The app provides an intuitive, graphical representation of how sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process in real-time.

Features:
* Interactive Visualization: Watch the step-by-step sorting process with animated bars representing array elements.
* Different Sorting Algorithms:
      * Bubble Sort
      * Insertion Sort
      * Selection Sort
      * Quick Sort
      * Merge Sort
      * Heap Sort
* Adjustable Array Size: Change the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform.
* Array Reset: Generate new arrays to sort.
* Responsive UI: Easily adjust settings and start sorting with the click of a button.

Tech Stack:
* Frontend: React
* Styling: CSS (custom styles for animations)
* [Hosting: Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

How It Works:
1. Select a sorting algorithm from the header.
2. Set the array size using the slider.
3. Click "Sort" to start visualizing the algorithm.
4. Reset the array to test the same or different algorithm on new data.

Algorithms Explained:
1. Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. Selection Sort: Selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next element.
4. Merge Sort: A divide and conquer algorithm that splits the array in half, recursively sorts, and merges the halves.
5. Quick Sort: Picks a pivot element, partitions the array, and sorts the partitions recursively.
6. Heap Sort: Builds a heap from the array, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and restores the heap property.

How to Run the Project Locally:
